# OOP

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a style of programming characterized by 
the identification of classes of objects closely linked with the methods 
(functions) with which they are associated.

## 4 pillars of OOP

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is a technique of restricting a user from directly modifying 
the data members or variables of a class in order to maintain the integrity 
of the data.

### Inheritance

Inheritance is a technique of acquiring the properties of another class 
having features in common. It allows us to increase the reusability and 
reduce the duplication of code. It is also known as a child-parent 
relationship, where a child inherits the properties of its parent. 
This is the reason it is called ‘is-a relationship’ where the child is-a 
type of parent.

### Abstraction

Abstraction is a technique of providing only the essential details to the 
user by hiding the unnecessary or irrelevant details of an entity. 
This helps in reducing the operational complexity at the user-end.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism means “many forms”. By its name, it is a feature that 
allows you to perform an action in multiple or different ways.

## Benefits

- easier troubleshooting
- can reuse code (inheritance)
- flexibility (polymorphism)
- clearer structure and readability
- easier to maintain

## Packages

packages are used to extend the functionality of python
to use a package, import it:
```python
import [package name]

[package name].[function name]()
```
or
```python
from [package name] import *

[function name]()
```
